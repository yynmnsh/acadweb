This guide will walk you through deploying your academic website to GitHub Pages step by step.

## Prerequisites

## Step 2: Upload Website Files

### Option A: Using GitHub Web Interface (Recommended for beginners)

1. **Prepare Files**

   - Ensure you have all files from the `academic-website` directory

2. **Upload Files**
   - In your new GitHub repository, click "uploading an existing file"
   - Drag and drop ALL files and folders from the `academic-website` directory
   - This includes:

     - css/ folder with stylesheets
     - js/ folder with JavaScript files
     - admin-secret-portal/ folder

   - Click "Commit changes"

### Option B: Using Git Command Line

```bash
# Clone your repository
git clone https://github.com/yourusername/your-repository-name.git
cd your-repository-name

# Copy all website files to this directory
# (copy all files from academic-website folder)

# Add all files
git add .

# Commit changes
git commit -m "Initial website deployment"

git push origin main
```

## Step 3: Enable GitHub Pages
